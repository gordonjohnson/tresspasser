This is a re-creation of the Tresspasser puzzle mini-game from the Ratchet and Clank series written in React and Typescript.

The objective of the game is to connect the outer power receptor ports with laser beams. The laser beams are located on concentric inner rings that the player must rotate and align in order to connect to the receptors. Be careful however, because the laser beams can be blocked by other lasers and blocker walls in the way.
